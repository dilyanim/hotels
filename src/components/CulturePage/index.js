              allowed them to survive, is <br /> always of interest to
              researchers, travelers, tourists. That reasonable sufficiency,
              <br />
              accumulated for centuries in the way of life of the people, their

              The nomadic lifestyle imposes its own conditions on a person's
              life. And this means that his housing should be adapted and
              comfortable for life. Therefore, the <br /> traditional dwelling
              of the Kyrgyz was a yurt, the basis of which was a wooden frame,
              located around the circumference, which ended with a domed tent.
              In the <br /> center of the tent there was a hole for the smoke to
              escape from the hearth, which in winter was bred for warmth in the
              yurt. The walls of the yurt were covered with <br /> mats made of
              chiya (hard grain), on top of which thick pieces of felt plates
              were superimposed. To the left of the entrance to the yurt was the
              male half, to which <br /> there are male household items:
              saddles, harness for horses, hunting items, etc. To the right of
              the entrance to the yurt was the female half. In the center of the
              yurt <br /> there was a hearth, behind which there were piles of
              blankets and chests on a wooden stand against the wall. Carpets
              are a special decoration of the yurt. The place <br /> behind the
              hearth is the most honorable. It was rightfully occupied by the
              owner of the house or the guest of honor. For the winter, Kyrgyz
              families gathered together, <br /> and in the spring they broke up
              into groups and went to roam with flocks of animals to
              high-altitude pastures. <br /> The dwellings of the Kyrgyz, who
              live sedentary and engaged in agriculture, were houses built of
              adobe bricks. The adobe brick was clay mixed with finely chopped{" "}
              <br />
              grass dried in the sun. In Kyrgyz homes, as before, felt carpets,
              wall panels with embroidery, chests for storing things play an
              important role in the interior of the <br /> house. Traditionally,
              Kyrgyz people do a lot of work together. Near the Kirghiz's house
              there is a veranda, usually covered with grapes, fruit trees grow
              around the <br /> house, there are many flowers, cattle pens are
              located in the distance. <br /> The dwelling of the urban Kyrgyz
              is usually a sectional apartment, usually consisting of two,
              three, four rooms, cabinet furniture stands along the walls,
              carpets on <br /> the floor and on the walls in the middle of the
              room.

                Kyrgyz clothing was also adapted to the living conditions caused
                by the type of activity. It was a calico or calico shirt, loose
                trousers with a drawstring. Over the shirt was worn a doublet,
                sewn close-fitting, in cold weather, over which a robe on cotton
                wool or homespun cloth was worn. Kyrgyz winter clothes are
                sheepskin sheepskin coats and trousers made of sheep's wool with
                fur inside. Kyrgyz shoes are boots with soft soles without
                heels. The summer headdress of the Kyrgyz is a cap made of thin,
                white felt with lapels made of black velvet. The winter
                headdress was a hat with earflaps made of sheep skins. <br />
                <br />
                Traditional women's clothing consisted of a long white shirt,
                which simultaneously served as a dress and long trousers, which
                were worn under the dress. A sleeveless jacket or doublet was
                worn over the dress. Girls and young women have sleeveless
                jackets and camisoles made of colored velvet. The clothes of
                married women also consisted of a kind of skirt with a wide belt
                and bright embroidery, which was sewn from sheep skins, the fur
                is located inside. They were worn in the cold season. On the
                head of a married woman, you can see a headdress-a turban made
                of fine muslin, the girls wore round caps trimmed with fluffy
                fur and decorated with owl feathers. Modern Kyrgyz clothing is
                common. This is a business suit for everyday work, sportswear,
                sneakers, light dresses made of cotton and silk - women's
                outfit.

              The social life of the Kyrgyz determined the nomadic way of life.
              The monotonous course of life on the nomads was disrupted by
              family holidays, in which all residents of the village took part.
              It was the birth of a boy, his circumcision, weddings,
              commemorations were accompanied by abundant treats. <br />
              <br />A big event in the village was the arrival of storytellers
              and musicians, whose performance attracted a lot of people. In
              winter, men's parties were arranged, komuz (stringed musical
              instrument) was played here, and various games were played. The
              most important issues for the Kyrgyz were solved by a council of
              elders, the people traditionally adopted different forms of mutual
              assistance, both kindred and neighborly.

              Kyrgyz families are usually large, they lived together. The head
              of the family is <br /> the father, who managed all the property.
              The wife was deprived of the right to <br /> vote and did not own
              property. In the event of her husband's death, the children <br />{" "}
              remained in the families of relatives. The widow used to be
              married off to the <br /> brother of the deceased. The funeral
              ceremony took place on the day of the <br /> death, the deceased
              was buried in a shroud, a mud-brick structure like a <br />{" "}

              were <br /> held on the third, seventh and fortieth day and a year

              Traditionally, the leading place in the oral folk art of the
              Kyrgyz is an epic genre, <br /> the pearl of which is the heroic
              epic trilogy "Manas", which tells about the exploits <br /> of the
              hero Manas, his son Semetey and grandson Seitek. The image of a

              woman reflects the portrait of the beautiful Kanykey - Manas'
              wife, intelligent, <br /> insightful, beautiful. The epic depicts
