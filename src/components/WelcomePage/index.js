                Kyrgyzstan is a real pearl of Central Asia and one <br /> of the
                most beautiful and original countries in the <br /> world.
              </h1>
              <p>
                Even now, despite its relative obscurity, thousands of tourists
                visit our country <br /> every year and everyone finds something
                special here. Some people are attracted <br /> to rest on
                Issyk-Kul, on its friendly and warm shores. Someone is attracted
                by the <br /> amazing nomadic culture and traditions that the
                people of Kyrgyzstan preserve to <br /> this day. The strongest
                in body and spirit are called the high mountains of the Tien{" "}
                <br />
                Shan and Pamir, where lovers of hiking, mountaineers, cyclists,
                etc. test <br /> themselves for strength and enjoy untouched and
                wild nature. <br /> The almost primeval beauty of nature has
                been preserved in Kyrgyzstan: <br /> mountains, rivers, lakes
                and valleys are sparsely populated and practically <br />{" "}
                uninhabited by humans. Here you can feel like a real pioneer,
                discovering <br /> something new over and over again. <br />{" "}
                Choosing Kyrgyzstan as a place for rest and travel, you will
                certainly get a lot of <br /> new and vivid sensations. And the
                tourist guide to Kyrgyzstan{" "}

                will help you decide on the choice of direction in your travels{" "}
                <br /> <br /> On the pages of the guide, we have tried to
