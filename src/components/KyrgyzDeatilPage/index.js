                Located in the northeast of Central Asia, Kyrgyzstan can be
                confidently called <br /> Central Asian Switzerland, because
                these two countries have a lot in common.
                <br /> Like European Switzerland, the territory of Kyrgyzstan is
                more than half located in <br /> the mountains, and even its
                low-lying regions do not fall below 401 meters <br /> above sea
                level. Neither one nor the other state has an exit to the sea
                itself. <br /> Kyrgyzstan stretches from east to west along the
                Tien Shan and Pamir-Alai <br /> chains. The highest peak is
                Victory Peak (7439 m). In the mountains, everything <br />{" "}
                breathes untouched, pristine beauty, which you will not see on
                the plains. The <br /> northern point of Kyrgyzstan is located
                at the same latitude as Rome, and the <br /> southern point is
                located with the island of Sicily. <br /> Square. If we compare
                the size, the Central Asian country of mountains is almost{" "}
                <br /> five times larger than Switzerland - its area is 199.9
                thousand square kilometers. <br />
                Portugal, Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands combined
                could fit here.

              part representatives of different <br /> peoples live separately.
              For example, Uzbeks, who make up 14.3%, settled in the southwest
              of the country; Russians, represented by 7.8%, live mainly in the

              the President once every six years, after which he will no longer
              be able to run. 120 members of parliament are elected for five
              years on <br /> party lists, and the head of government, in turn,
              is determined by the parliament itself. <br />{" "}

            <h1>The cuisine of Kyrgyzstan.</h1>
            <p>
              In modern Kyrgyzstan, almost in every part of it, you can meet any
              dish of Uzbek, Russian, Turkish or Iranian cuisine. The Kyrgyz
              people, of course, have their own <br /> culinary traditions, just
              because of the nomadic past, <span>Kyrgyz cuisine</span> is not
              particularly diverse.
              <br />
              For example, chicken dishes are completely absent from the
              national menu, because the breeding of these birds required
              sedentariness. But all kinds of options for <br />{" "}
              <span>fried and baked lamb</span> are presented here in the
              assortment. This was required again by a nomadic lifestyle,
              because in a hot climate, you can save meat only by <br /> frying
              it or wilting it.
              <br /> The brightest representatives of the native{" "}
              <span>Kyrgyz cuisine</span>
              are various versions of horse meat sausages. The most revered
              variety is <span>chuchuk</span>, where a piquant taste <br /> is
              achieved by more fatty varieties of meat and smoking. Many other
              snacks and dishes, such as <span>karta</span> and{" "}
              <span>karyn</span>, are prepared from horse meat. Fragrant and{" "}
              <br /> hearty <span>beshbarmak</span> is also very common.
              <br /> But, as it was said earlier, pilaf,{" "}
              <span>manti, chuchpara</span> and many other dishes from the
              cuisines of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkey, as well as Uighur
              dishes have long
              <br /> been firmly included in the culture of the people. The
              Great Silk Road had a great influence in this cuisine mix, the
              merit of which was in the transfer of not only
              <br /> goods, but also cultural features.
              <br /> <span>Honey</span> is especially revered in Kyrgyzstan.
              Consumed with local tortillas, it can sometimes be the main dish
              for breakfast. Locals also have a positive attitude to a<br />{" "}
              variety of fruits - they are visible and invisible in all bazaars
              of the country in the summer and autumn period. Apples from
              Issyk-Kul are rightfully considered one of
              <br /> the best in the world! Pumpkin is very much loved by Kyrgyz
              people from vegetables.
              <br /> A large layer in the national Kyrgyz cuisine is occupied by
              fermented milk drinks: koumiss, tan,<span>ayran</span>. They can
              be bought at any bazaar, in any store, and even
              <br /> along mountain roads.
              <br /> Kyrgyz people eat mainly on a<span>dasturkhan</span>{" "}
              (dastarkhan) - a narrow tablecloth spread on the floor. If you are
              lucky enough to be invited, and this is very likely due to
              <br /> the hospitality of the Kyrgyz, you need to remember several
              important rules: you should take food only with your right hand;
              when sitting down, your legs should not
              <br /> be directed towards the
              <span>dosturkhan</span>, it is better to tuck them under you or
              pull them to the side. Sneezing at the table is also a negative
              attitude.
